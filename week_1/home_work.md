for week 1's homework, we aim to finish from "Getting Started" to "Python Namespace".


Note about the homeworks:
* Try to read the contents of the lessons to the best of your ability.
* In our next lesson, we will discuess what has been assigned to you as a homework and of course, explain things in a detailed manner. The reason, I am giving you this homework is for you to be more confident when we have our next lesson and for me to save time explaining some trivialities.
